The boxes have walls that are 1 inch thick. There is also an added wooden board divider in the middle across the smallest dimension which is also 1 inch thick. What is the total inner volume of all the boxes?",36,"**Step 1: Determine the inner dimensions of each box.**

The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

* Width: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
* Height: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
* Depth: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

**Step 2: Determine the inner volume of one box.**

The inner volume of one box is:

* Volume = Width * Height * Depth
* Volume = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
* Volume = 24 cubic inches

**Step 3: Determine the inner volume of the divider.**

The divider is 1 inch thick and is placed across the smallest dimension, which is 2 inches. Therefore, the inner volume of the divider is:

* Volume = Width * Height * Depth
* Volume = 1 inch * 2 inches * 2 inches
* Volume = 4 cubic inches

**Step 4: Determine the total inner volume of all the boxes.**

There are 3 boxes, so the total inner volume of all the boxes is:

* Total Volume = Inner Volume of One Box * Number of Boxes + Inner Volume of Divider * Number of Dividers
* Total Volume = 24 cubic inches * 3 + 4 cubic inches * 3
* Total Volume = 72 cubic inches + 12 cubic inches

What are the possible ranges of values of variable X based on the given information?,X >= 2,"**Step 1: Determine the inner dimensions of each box.**

The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

* Width: X - 2 inches
* Height: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
* Depth: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

**Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of one box.**

The inner volume of one box is:

There after, the volume of each box becomes 1/(2 * 2 * 2) = 1/8 times the volume of the previous box. This is an infinite geometric series with common ratio of 1/8. Hence, the total volume of all the boxes combined = 210 / (1 - 1/8) cubic inches = 240 cubic inches ","**Step 1: Find the volume of the first box.**

The first box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 7 inches in size. So the volume of the first box is 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 cubic inches.

**Step 2: Find the volume of the second box.**

The second box is half the size of the first box in each dimension. So the second box is 2.5 inches by 3 inches by 3.5 inches in size. So the volume of the second box is 2.5 * 3 * 3.5 = 26.25 cubic inches.

**Step 3: Find the volume of the third box.**

The third box is half the size of the second box in each dimension. So the third box is 1.25 inches by 1.5 inches by 1.75 inches in size. So the volume of the third box is 1.25 * 1.5 * 1.75 = 2.8125 cubic inches.

**Step 4: Find the volume of the fourth box.**

The fourth box is half the size of the third box in each dimension. So the fourth box is 0.625 inches by 0.75 inches by 0.875 inches in size. So the volume of the fourth box is 0.625 * 0.75 * 0.875 = 0.390625 cubic inches.

Let's call the cost of the first glass X. Then the cost of the second glass is Y% of X, which is (Y/100) * X.

If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = 8 cheaper glasses.

And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * X.

**Step 5: Set the total cost equal to 64.**
Since Kylar needs to pay 64$ for the glasses, we can set the total cost equal to 64 and solve for X and Y.

Each glass is sold for a certain amount but every second glass costs only 60% of that original price. Kylar bought 16 glasses for 64 dollars. If each glass had cost a dollar more but every second glass was sold at 50% doscount, then how much would he have spend on the 16 glasses?",72,"**Step 1: Find the original price of each glass.**

Let's call the original price of each glass ""x"". We know that every second glass costs 60% of the original price, so the price of the second glass is 0.6x.

**Step 2: Find the number of glasses that were cheaper.**

Kylar bought 16 glasses, and every second glass was cheaper. So, the number of cheaper glasses is 16 / 2 = 8.

**Step 3: Find the total cost of the cheaper glasses.**

The cost of each cheaper glass is 0.6x. So, the total cost of the cheaper glasses is 8 * 0.6x = 4.8x.

**Step 4: Find the total cost of the regular-priced glasses.**

The number of regular-priced glasses is 16 - 8 = 8. So, the total cost of the regular-priced glasses is 8 * x = 8x.

**Step 5: Find the total cost of the glasses with the new prices.**

If each glass had cost a dollar more, then the original price of each glass would be x + 1. If every second glass was sold at a 50% discount, then the price of the second glass would be 0.5(x + 1).

**Step 6: Find the number of glasses that would have been cheaper.**

Kylar still bought 16 glasses, and every second glass would have been cheaper. So, the number of cheaper glasses would still be 16 / 2 = 8.

**Step 7: Find the total cost of the cheaper glasses with the new prices.**

The cost of each cheaper glass with the new prices would be 0.5(x + 1). So, the total cost of the cheaper glasses with the new prices would be 8 * 0.5(x + 1) = 4(x + 1).

**Step 8: Find the total cost of the regular-priced glasses with the new prices.**

The number of regular-priced glasses would still be 16 - 8 = 8. So, the total cost of the regular-priced glasses with the new prices would be 8 * (x + 1) = 8(x + 1).

**Step 9: Find the total cost of the glasses with the new prices.**

The total cost of the glasses with the new prices would be the sum of the total cost of the cheaper glasses and the total cost of the regular-priced glasses. So, the total cost of the glasses with the new prices would be 4(x + 1) + 8(x + 1) = 12(x + 1).

**Step 10: Set the total cost of the glasses with the new prices equal to the amount Kylar actually spent.**

We know that Kylar spent 64 dollars on the glasses. So, we can set the total cost of the glasses with the new prices equal to 64 and solve for x.

```
12(x + 1) = 64
x + 1 = 64 / 12
x + 1 = 5.33
x = 5.33 - 1
x = 4.33

The total minutes available for performances is the showtime in minutes minus the intermission time. So, the total minutes available for performances is 60X - 10 minutes.

The number of groups that can perform is the total minutes available for performances divided by the total minutes used by each group. So, the number of groups that can perform is (60X - 10) / (Y + 4).

(60X - 10) / (Y + 4) = 11

* Therefore, the total time available for performances is 120 * X - 20 minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate the time each group will use.**

* Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage.
* Therefore, each group will use a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of groups that can perform.**

* The number of groups that can perform is the total time available for performances divided by the time each group will use.
* Therefore, the number of groups that can perform is (120 * X - 20) / 10.

**Final Answer:** The number of groups that can perform is (120 * X - 20) / 10.",TRUE

The total show time is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. The intermission will take 10 minutes, so the time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the time each group will use.**

Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. However, the time to exit the stage is now X minutes less than planned, so the total time each group will use is 2 + 6 + (2 - X) = 10 - X minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can perform.**

The number of groups that can perform is equal to the total time available for performances divided by the time each group will use. So, the number of groups is 110 / (10 - X).

**Step 4: Calculate the new intermission time.**

The new intermission time is equal to the total show time minus the time available for performances minus the time each group will use. So, the new intermission time is 120 - 110 - (10 - X) = 10 + X minutes.

Lilly collected six times the insects that David collected. David found that even if he squares the number of insects he found, it will still be 5 short of what Lily found. If both of them found more than one insects, then how many insects did they found in total?",35,"**Step 1: Define a variable**
Let D = the number of insects David collected

**Step 2: How many insects did Lily collect?**
Lily = 6 * D

**Step 3: Write an equation**
D^2 + 5 = 6 * D

**Step 4: Simplify**
D^2 - 6 * D + 5 = 0

**Step 5: Factor**
(D - 5)(D - 1) = 0

**Step 6: Solve for D**
D = 5 or D = 1

**Step 7: Check the solutions**
If D = 5, then Lily = 6 * 5 = 30. This satisfies the equation D^2 + 5 = 6 * D.
If D = 1, then Lily = 6 * 1 = 6. This does not satisfy the equation D^2 + 5 = 6 * D.

**Step 8: Therefore, David collected 5 insects and Lily collected 30 insects.**
