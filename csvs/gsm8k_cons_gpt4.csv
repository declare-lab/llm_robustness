1. Determine the discount price of one glass by multiplying the original price by 60/100.
2. Find out how many glasses would be bought at the cheaper price by dividing the total number of glasses by 2.
3. Calculate the total cost for the cheaper glasses by multiplying the discount price by the number of cheaper glasses.

The reasoning pathway 2 is correct. The total time available for the concert is 120 minutes (2 hours) minus the 10-minute intermission, which equals 110 minutes. In the original plan, each group takes 4 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage and 2 minutes to exit the stage), and 11 groups can perform. This means each group has 6 minutes to perform. If the performance time is increased by one minute, each group will take 7 minutes in total. Therefore, 110 minutes divided by 7 minutes per group equals approximately 15.7 groups. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to 15 groups. So, the number of less groups that can perform in the concert in the new plan is 11 groups - 15 groups = -4 groups.
