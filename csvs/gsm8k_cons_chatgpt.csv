If John wants to entirely fill these boxes with small cubes each measuring 0.5 inch on all sides, then how many cubes will he need?","1) 72

2) 576","Reasoning Pathway 1:
To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box. The inner volume of one box can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the walls from the total volume of the box. The total volume of the box can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the box. The volume of the walls can be calculated by subtracting the inner volume of the box (length - 2) x (width - 2) x (height - 2) from the total volume of the box. Once we have the inner volume of one box, we can multiply it by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Final answer: The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is [Final answer].

To find the number of small cubes needed to fill the boxes, we need to divide the total inner volume of all 3 boxes by the volume of one small cube. The volume of one small cube can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the cube.

Final answer: John will need [Final answer] small cubes to fill the boxes.

Reasoning Pathway 2:
To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then multiply it by 3.

The volume of each box can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the walls from the total volume of the box.

The total volume of each box is given by the formula: length x width x height.

The length of each box is 5 inches, the width is 6 inches, and the height is 4 inches.

The volume of the walls can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the inner box from the volume of the outer box.

The inner box has dimensions (length - 2) x (width - 2) x (height - 2).

The volume of the inner box is (5-2) x (6-2) x (4-2) = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

The volume of the outer box is 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches.

The volume of the walls is 120 - 24 = 96 cubic inches.

Therefore, the volume of each box is 120 - 96 = 24 cubic inches.

To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of each box by 3: 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Final answer: The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

To find the number of small cubes needed to fill the boxes, we divide the total inner volume of the boxes by the volume of each small cube.

The volume of each small cube is given by the formula: side x side x side.

The side length of each small cube is 0.5 inch.

The volume of each small cube is 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125 cubic inches.

To find the number of small cubes needed, we divide the total inner volume of the boxes (72 cubic inches) by the volume of each small cube (0.125 cubic inches): 72 / 0.125 = 576 small cubes.

Final answer: John will need 576 small cubes to fill all 3 boxes.
