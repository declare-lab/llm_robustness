Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?
Follow this plan and write these steps down to solve the question:
[#Solution Plan#]
1. Define B as the number of insects collected by Bodhi. 
2. Define the number of insects collected by David as half of what Bodhi collected.
3. Define the number of insects collected by Lily as half of what Bodhi collected plus 7.
4. Add up the insects collected by Bodhi, David, and Lily and set the equation equal to 43, the total number of insects collected.
5. Solve for B. This will be the number of insects collected by Bodhi.
6. Divide B by 2 to get the number of insects collected by David.
7. Add 7 to David's number to get the number of insects collected by Lily.","```python
