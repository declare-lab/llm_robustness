Strating from the second box each box is half the size of the previous box in each dimension. What is the total volume all the boxes combined?","The volume of the first box is (5 * 6 * 7) = 210 cubic inches. There after, the volume of each box becomes 1/(2 * 2 * 2) = 1/8 times the volume of the previous box. This is an infinite geometric series with common ratio of 1/8. Hence, the total volume of all the boxes combined = 210 / (1 - 1/8) cubic inches = 240 cubic inches ","Reasoning Steps:

1. Let's denote the length, width, and height of the first box as l1, w1, and h1, respectively. We are given that l1 = 5 inches, w1 = 6 inches, and h1 = 7 inches.

2. Since each box starting from the second box is half the size of the previous box in each dimension, the length, width, and height of the nth box can be expressed as:

   - Length (ln) = l1 / 2^(n-1)
   - Width (wn) = w1 / 2^(n-1)
   - Height (hn) = h1 / 2^(n-1)

3. The volume of the nth box (Vn) can be calculated using the formula:

   - Vn = ln * wn * hn

4. Substituting the expressions for ln, wn, and hn from step 2, we get:

   - Vn = (l1 / 2^(n-1)) * (w1 / 2^(n-1)) * (h1 / 2^(n-1))
   - Vn = (l1 * w1 * h1) / 2^(3n-3)

5. To find the total volume of all the boxes combined, we need to sum the volumes of all the boxes from n = 1 to infinity. This can be expressed as:

   - Total Volume = V1 + V2 + V3 + ... + Vn + ...

   - Total Volume = Σ (l1 * w1 * h1) / 2^(3n-3) from n = 1 to infinity

6. This infinite sum can be evaluated using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

   - Sum = a / (1 - r)

   - where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

7. In this case, a = (l1 * w1 * h1) and r = 1/8 (since 2^(3n-3) approaches 1/8 as n approaches infinity).

8. Substituting these values, we get:

   - Total Volume = (l1 * w1 * h1) / (1 - 1/8)
   - Total Volume = (l1 * w1 * h1) / (7/8)

9. Plugging in the values of l1, w1, and h1, we get:

   - Total Volume = (5 * 6 * 7) / (7/8)
   - Total Volume = 210 / (7/8)
   - Total Volume = 210 * 8/7

Question: John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick.
What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?
Solution:
The walls subtract a (1 + 1) = 2 inches from each dimension. So, each box has a reduced width of (5 - 2) = 3 inches, reduced length of (6 - 2) = 4 inches and reduced height of (4 - 2) = 2 inches. 
So the inner volume of each box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches. 
The total inner volume of 3 boxes are 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.
Alternative Step by Step Solution:","The total volume of each box = 5 * 6 * 4 = 120 cubic inches. The cube has 6  surfaces where a certain volume contributes to the wall volume. 
The wall volume corresponding to the (width, length) surface =  2 * (2  * (5 + 6) - 4) = 36 cubic inches. 
The wall volume corresponding to the (width, height) surface =  2 * (2  * (5 + 4) - 4) = 28 cubic inches.
The wall volume corresponding to the (height, length) surface =  2 * (2  * (4 + 6) - 4) = 32 cubic inches.
Hence, the iner volume of each box = 120 - 36 - 28- 32 = 24 cubic inches.
The total inner volume of 3 boxes = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches. ","Reasoning Step:
1. Calculate the outer volume of each box:
Outer volume = length * width * height
Outer volume = 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches
Outer volume = 120 cubic inches

2. Calculate the inner volume of each box:
Inner volume = (length - 2 inches) * (width - 2 inches) * (height - 2 inches)
Inner volume = (5 inches - 2 inches) * (6 inches - 2 inches) * (4 inches - 2 inches)
Inner volume = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

If the final profit is not affected then what was the maximum possible return % in the electronics gadget market?",0.78125 %,"Reasoning Steps:

1. Let the initial profit percentage in the jewelry market be x%.

2. According to the given information, the profit percentage in the jewelry market after 2.5% growth is (x + 2.5)%.

3. Since the merchant maximizes his profit by choosing jewelry, we can conclude that:
(x + 2.5)% > (y + 2.5)%, where y is the profit percentage in the electronics gadget market.

4. Now, let's assume the potential purchase amount of electronics gadgets was doubled, which means the new purchase amount is 2 * $8000 = $16000.

5. If the final profit is not affected, then the profit percentage in the electronics gadget market should remain the same, i.e., y%.

6. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Follow this plan to solve the question:
[#Solution Plan#]
First, calculate the profit he would make if he purchased jewelry by using the given profit rate. Then, calculate the profit he would make if he purchased electronic gadgets using the given profit rate. Compare the two profits. If the profit from purchasing jewelry is greater than the profit from purchasing electronic gadgets, he should purchase jewelry. If the profit from purchasing electronic gadgets is greater, he should purchase electronic gadgets.",125,"Reasoning Step:

1. Calculate the profit he would make if he purchased jewelry by using the given profit rate:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Selling price = Cost price + (Cost price * Profit rate)
Selling price = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%)
Selling price = $5,000 + $125
Selling price = $5,125
Profit = $5,125 - $5,000
Profit = $125

2. Calculate the profit he would make if he purchased electronic gadgets using the given profit rate:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Selling price = Cost price + (Cost price * Profit rate)
Selling price = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%)
Selling price = $8,000 + $96
Selling price = $8,096
Profit = $8,096 - $8,000
Profit = $96

3. Compare the two profits:
Profit from purchasing jewelry = $125
Profit from purchasing electronic gadgets = $96

Since the profit from purchasing jewelry is greater than the profit from purchasing electronic gadgets, the merchant should purchase jewelry.

125",Define Rules,"In an alternative universe, a merchant must choose between acquiring gems valued at $5,000 or smart gadgets valued at $8,000. An economic seer predicts that in the next lunar phase, the gems will increase in value due to a Meldorean Shift Factor of 2.5, and the smart gadgets by a factor of 1.2. In this universe, a Meldorean Shift translates to logistic growth in our world, following the formula:

Y = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(X-X_0)}}

Where:
- Y is the predicted value after growth.
- L is the carrying capacity, set as twice the original value of the item. For gems, L = 2 * 5000 = 10000, and for smart gadgets, L = 2 * 8000 = 16000.
- e is the base of the natural logarithm.
- k is the growth rate, which is the Meldorean Shift Factor. For gems, k = 2.5, and for smart gadgets, k = 1.2.
- X is the current time period, which is 1 lunar phase, so X = 1.
- X_0 is the midpoint of the growth curve, which is 0 in this scenario, so X_0 = 0.

Question: A merchant wants to make a choice of purchase between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2% within the same month. If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of this month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?",1111101,"Reasoning Step:

1. Calculate the projected value of jewelry after 2.5% increase:
Projected Jewelry Value = $5,000 * (1 + 2.5%) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. Calculate the projected value of electronic gadgets after 1.2% increase:
Projected Gadgets Value = $8,000 * (1 + 1.2%) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,100

3. Determine the profit for each purchase option:
Profit from Jewelry = Projected Jewelry Value - Initial Jewelry Value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Profit from Gadgets = Projected Gadgets Value - Initial Gadgets Value = $8,100 - $8,000 = $100

4. Compare the profits to identify the better choice:

8 glasses * $5 per glass * 60% = $24

3. Add the cost of the first 8 glasses and the remaining 8 glasses to find the total cost of the glasses:
$40 + $24 = $64

4. Subtract the cost of the glasses from Kylar's budget to find the remaining money:
$100 - $64 = $36

5. Calculate how many lamps Kylar can buy with the remaining money:
$36 / $20 per lamp = 1.8 lamps

6. Since Kylar can't buy a fraction of a lamp, he can buy 1 lamp.

"Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.  How much does he need to pay for them?
Answer:
The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
        If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
        So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.

1. Let the original price of each glass be x dollars.

2. Since every second glass costs 60% of the original price, the price of the second, fourth, sixth, ..., sixteenth glasses is 0.6x dollars.

If he wants to minimize the purchase price, then how much does he need to pay for the 15 glasses?","1st case: $61

2nd case: $60

minimum = $60","Reasoning Steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of buying 15 glasses from the first store:**

   - The first glass costs $5.
   - Every second glass costs 60% of the previous glass.
   - So, the second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
   - The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.80.
   - And so on.

   - To find the total cost of buying 15 glasses, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

     ```
     Total cost = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
     ```

     - In this case, n = 15 (the number of glasses), the first term is $5, and the last term is $0.30 (the cost of the 15th glass).

     - Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

       ```

2. **Calculate the cost of buying 15 glasses from the second store:**

   - Each glass costs $6.
   - But you get one glass for free when you purchase two glasses.
   - So, effectively, you pay for only 14 glasses.

   - The total cost of buying 15 glasses from the second store is:

     ```
     Total cost = 14 * $6 = $84

"Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.  How much does he need to pay for them?
Answer:
The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
        If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.

1. Let's assume Kylar bought X glasses in total.

3. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.6 = $3.

4. The third glass costs $5 again.

8. The total cost can be expressed as:

   Total cost = (Cost of first glass) + (Cost of second glass) + (Cost of third glass) + ... + (Cost of Xth glass)

9. We can simplify this expression by grouping the costs of the glasses in pairs:

   Total cost = ($5 + $3) + ($5 + $3) + ... + ($5 + $3)

The cost of every second glass follows the same pattern: 60% of the previous glass's cost.

4. Calculate the total number of glasses:
Total glasses = 1600

5. Determine the number of pairs of glasses:
Since every second glass costs 60% of the previous one, we can group the glasses into pairs. Each pair consists of one glass at the original price and one glass at 60% of the original price.

6. Calculate the number of pairs:
Number of pairs = Total glasses / 2 = 1600 / 2 = 800

1. Let's first calculate the probability of getting a discounted glass. Since every second glass has a 50% chance of being discounted, the probability of getting a discounted glass is 1/2.

2. Now, let's calculate the expected cost of a single glass. The expected cost is the sum of the product of the cost of a glass and the probability of getting that cost. So, the expected cost of a single glass is:

Expected cost = (Cost of a regular glass * Probability of getting a regular glass) + (Cost of a discounted glass * Probability of getting a discounted glass)
Expected cost = ($5 * 1/2) + ($5 * 0.6 * 1/2)
Expected cost = $2.5 + $1.5

"Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances. Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time. Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

"Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances. Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time. Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

Suppose you want to find out the number of groups that can perform in the concert. What redundant information is provided that are not required to calculate that?",The school has a total of 500 students.,"Reasoning Step:

1. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

2. Each group requires a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage.

3. The intermission break is 10 minutes long.

4. Therefore, the total time available for groups to perform is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

5. Each group requires 10 minutes to perform, so the number of groups that can perform is 110 / 10 = 11.

3. Divide the total time available for the concert by the total time each group will use to find the number of groups that can perform.

Answer:
1. Total time available for the concert = Total show time - Intermission time
= 120 minutes - 10 minutes
= 110 minutes

2. Total time each group will use = Time for getting on stage + Time for performing + Time for exiting the stage
= 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes

"Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances. Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.

First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances. Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time. Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a intermission which has a 60% chance to be 10 minutes and a 40% chance to be 20 minutes. What is the expected number of groups that can perform in the concert?",10.6,"Reasoning Steps:

1. Calculate the total time available for performances:
Total time = 2 hours = 120 minutes

2. Calculate the time required for each group:
Time per group = 2 minutes (to get on stage) + 6 minutes (to perform) + 2 minutes (to exit stage) = 10 minutes

3. Calculate the number of groups that can perform without intermission:
Number of groups = Total time available / Time per group
Number of groups = 120 minutes / 10 minutes = 12 groups

4. Calculate the expected time for the intermission:
Expected time = (Probability of 10-minute intermission * Time of 10-minute intermission) + (Probability of 20-minute intermission * Time of 20-minute intermission)
Expected time = (0.6 * 10 minutes) + (0.4 * 20 minutes) = 16 minutes

5. Calculate the total time available for performances with intermission:
Total time with intermission = Total time available - Expected time for intermission
Total time with intermission = 120 minutes - 16 minutes = 104 minutes

6. Calculate the number of groups that can perform with intermission:
Number of groups with intermission = Total time with intermission / Time per group
Number of groups with intermission = 104 minutes / 10 minutes = 10.4 groups

7. Round the number of groups to the nearest whole number:
Expected number of groups = 10 groups

1. Let's assume David found ""x"" insects.

2. According to the given information, Lily found 7 more than David. So, Lily found (x + 7) insects.

3. David found half of what Bodhi found. Let's assume Bodhi found ""y"" insects. Then, David found (y/2) insects.

4. Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. So, we can set up the equation:
(x + 7) + (y/2) + y = 43

5. Simplifying the equation:
(x + 7) + (3y/2) = 43

6. Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

1. Let the number of insects collected by David be D, and the number of insects collected by Bodhi be B.

2. From the given information, we know that:
   - Lily found 7 more than David: Lily = D + 7
   - David found half of what Bodhi found: D = B/2

3. The total number of insects collected by all three is 43: Lily + David + Bodhi = 43

4. Substituting the expressions for Lily and David from steps 2 and 3, we get:
   - (D + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

5. Simplifying the equation:
   - 3B/2 + D + 7 = 43

6. Substituting the expression for D from step 2:
   - 3B/2 + (B/2) + 7 = 43

7. Combining like terms:
   - 2B + 7 = 43

8. Solving for B:
   - B = (43 - 7) / 2
   - B = 18

9. Now, assume the number of insects collected by each is scaled X times. This means:
   - Lily's new collection = X * (Lily's original collection)
   - David's new collection = X * (David's original collection)
   - Bodhi's new collection = X * (Bodhi's original collection)

10. Substituting the values of Lily's, David's, and Bodhi's original collections, we get:
    - Lily's new collection = X * (D + 7)

"Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found.  How many insects did Lily find?
Answer:
Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43
2B = <<36=36>>36
B = <<18=18>>18 insects

16",Theoretical Challenge,"David and Lily collected some insects during their lunch break. Lilly collected six times the insects that David collected. David found that even if he squares the number of insects he found, it will still be 5 short of what Lily found. If both of them found more than one insects, then how many insects did they found in total?",35,"Reasoning Steps:
1. Let the number of insects David collected be x.
2. According to the given information, Lily collected 6 times the insects that David collected, so Lily collected 6x insects.
3. David found that even if he squares the number of insects he found, it will still be 5 short of what Lily found. This can be expressed as x^2 = 6x - 5.
4. Rearranging the equation, we get x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0.
5. Factoring the equation, we get (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0.
6. Setting each factor to zero, we get x - 5 = 0 and x - 1 = 0.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 5 and x = 1.
8. Since both David and Lily found more than one insect, we can discard the solution x = 1.

In a baking competition, three bakers, Sarah, John, and Emily, made a total of 65 pastries. Sarah made 5 more than John. John made one-third of what Emily made. How many pastries did Sarah make?

Reasoning Steps:

1. Let's assign variables to represent the number of pastries each baker made:
   - Sarah: x
   - John: y
   - Emily: z

2. From the given information, we can set up the following equations:
   - x = y + 5
   - y = z / 3
   - x + y + z = 65

3. Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   - x = (z / 3) + 5

   - ((z / 3) + 5) + (z / 3) + z = 65

5. Simplify and solve for z:
   - (2z / 3) + 5 + (z / 3) + z = 65
   - 3z / 3 + 5 = 65
   - z + 5 = 65

Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 stones. Lilly found 6.5 stones less than what David found. Bodhi found double the number of stones that David found. How many stones did Lily find?",Stones are generally counted in whole numbers.,"Reasoning Steps:

1. Let's assume David found ""x"" stones.

2. According to the given information, Lily found 6.5 stones less than what David found. So, Lily found (x - 6.5) stones.

3. Bodhi found double the number of stones that David found. So, Bodhi found (2 * x) stones.

4. The total number of stones collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x - 6.5) + x + (2 * x) = 43

5. Combining like terms:

4x - 6.5 = 43

6. Adding 6.5 to both sides:

4x = 49.5

7. Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 12.375

8. Since the number of stones found cannot be a fraction, we can round it up to the nearest whole number.

David found approximately 12 stones.

9. Substituting the value of x back into the equation for Lily's stones:

Lily found (12 - 6.5) = 5.5 stones.

"Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found.  How many insects did Lily find?
Answer:
Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43
2B = <<36=36>>36
B = <<18=18>>18 insects
David = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects
Lily = 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 insects
Lily found <<16=16>>16 insects.
16",Value Error,"Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected -43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found twice of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?",no correct answer,"Reasoning Steps:

1. Let's assume David found ""x"" insects.

2. According to the given information, Lily found 7 more than David. So, Lily found (x + 7) insects.

3. David found twice of what Bodhi found. So, Bodhi found (x / 2) insects.

4. Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected -43 insects. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
(x + 7) + x + (x / 2) = -43

5. Combining like terms:
(2.5x + 7) = -43

6. Subtracting 7 from both sides:
2.5x = -50

7. Dividing both sides by 2.5:
x = -20

8. Substituting the value of x back into the equation for Lily's insects:
Lily found (x + 7) = (-20 + 7) = -13 insects.

16",Value Complex,"Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7+2i more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found.
How many insects did Lily find?",16+1.5i,"Reasoning Steps:

1. Let x be the number of insects David found.
2. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, Bodhi found 2x insects.
3. Lily found 7+2i more than David, so Lily found x + 7 + 2i insects.
4. Together, they found 43 insects, so x + 2x + x + 7 + 2i = 43.
5. Combining like terms, we get 4x + 7 + 2i = 43.
6. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 4x + 2i = 36.
7. Subtracting 2i from both sides, we get 4x = 36 - 2i.
8. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 9 - 0.5i.
9. Substituting x = 9 - 0.5i into the equation for the number of insects Lily found, we get Lily found 9 - 0.5i + 7 + 2i = 16 + 1.5i insects.

16",Value Probability,"Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David has a 50% chance of finding half of what Bodhi found and a 50% chance of finding the same amount as Bodhi. What is the expected number of insects that Lily have found?",17.5,"Reasoning Steps:

1. Let x be the number of insects David found.

2. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects.

3. There are two possible scenarios for David's findings:

   - Scenario 1: David finds half of what Bodhi found. Let y be the number of insects Bodhi found. Then, David finds y/2 insects.

   - Scenario 2: David finds the same amount as Bodhi. Then, David finds y insects.

4. The probability of each scenario is 50%.

5. The expected number of insects David found is the average of the two possible scenarios:

   E(David) = (0.5)(y/2) + (0.5)(y) = 0.75y

6. The total number of insects collected is 43, so:

   Lily + David + Bodhi = 43

7. Substituting the expressions for Lily and David in terms of x and y, we get:

   (x + 7) + 0.75y + y = 43

8. Simplifying the equation, we get:

   1.75y + x = 36

9. We cannot solve for x directly because we do not know the value of y. However, we can find the expected value of Lily's findings by taking the expected value of both sides of the equation:

   E(Lily + David + Bodhi) = E(43)

   E(Lily) + E(David) + E(Bodhi) = 43

10. Since the expected value of a constant is the constant itself, we have:

   E(Lily) + E(David) + E(Bodhi) = 43

11. Substituting the expression for E(David) from step 5, we get:

   E(Lily) + 0.75E(Bodhi) + E(Bodhi) = 43

12. Simplifying the equation, we get:

   E(Lily) + 1.75E(Bodhi) = 43

13. We still cannot solve for E(Lily) directly because we do not know the value of E(Bodhi). However, we can use the fact that the expected value of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of the expected values of the individual random variables:

   E(Lily + David + Bodhi) = E(Lily) + E(David) + E(Bodhi)

14. Since Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects in total, we have:

   43 = E(Lily) + E(David) + E(Bodhi)

15. Substituting the expression for E(David) from step 5, we get:

   43 = E(Lily) + 0.75E(Bodhi) + E(Bodhi)

16. Simplifying the equation, we get:

   43 = E(Lily) + 1.75E(Bodhi)

17. Therefore, the expected number of insects that Lily found is:

   E(Lily) = 43 - 1.75E(Bodhi)
