According to the problem, the second glass costs only Y% of the price of the first glass. So, the price of the second glass would be (Y/100) * X dollars.

Similarly, the third glass would cost (Y/100) * [(Y/100) * X] dollars, the fourth glass would cost (Y/100) * [(Y/100) * [(Y/100) * X]] dollars, and so on.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, the total cost of all the glasses would be:

# Loop to find the values of X and Y
for X in range(1, 100):  # assuming X can be any value from 1 to 99

1. Determine the discount price of one glass by multiplying the original price by 60/100.
2. Find out how many glasses would be bought at the cheaper price by dividing the total number of glasses by 2.
3. Calculate the total cost for the cheaper glasses by multiplying the discount price by the number of cheaper glasses.
4. Calculate the total cost for regular-priced glasses by multiplying the original price by the number of regular-priced glasses.
5. Determine the total cost for all the glasses by adding the total cost of the cheaper glasses and the total cost of the regular-priced glasses.","#Solution Plan#

1. Determine the discount price of one glass by multiplying the original price by 60/100.

```python
original_price = 5
discount_price = original_price * (60/100)
```

2. Find out how many glasses would be bought at the cheaper price by dividing the total number of glasses by 2.

```python
total_glasses = 16
cheaper_glasses = total_glasses // 2
```

3. Calculate the total cost for the cheaper glasses by multiplying the discount price by the number of cheaper glasses.

```python
cheaper_cost = discount_price * cheaper_glasses
```

4. Calculate the total cost for regular-priced glasses by multiplying the original price by the number of regular-priced glasses.

```python
regular_glasses = total_glasses - cheaper_glasses
regular_cost = original_price * regular_glasses
```

5. Determine the total cost for all the glasses by adding the total cost of the cheaper glasses and the total cost of the regular-priced glasses.

```python

Let's assume the number of participating groups is 'n' and the time saved for each group is 'X' minutes.

The total time taken by all the groups to exit the stage initially is given by:
initial_exit_time = (2 + 6 + 2) * n

The total time saved for all the groups is given by:
total_time_saved = X * n

The new exit time for each group is given by:
new_exit_time = (2 + 6 + 2 - X)

The new total time taken by all the groups to exit the stage is given by:
new_total_exit_time = new_exit_time * n

The total show time remains the same, which is 2 hours or 120 minutes.

The time allowed for the intermission is the remaining time after subtracting the total exit time from the total show time:
intermission_time = 120 - (initial_exit_time - total_time_saved + new_total_exit_time)

Now, let's write the code block to solve this problem:

```python
# Input values
n = 10  # Number of participating groups
X = 1   # Time saved for each group in minutes

# Calculate initial exit time
initial_exit_time = (2 + 6 + 2) * n

# Calculate total time saved
total_time_saved = X * n

# Calculate new exit time for each group
new_exit_time = (2 + 6 + 2 - X)

# Calculate new total exit time
new_total_exit_time = new_exit_time * n

# Calculate intermission time
intermission_time = 120 - (initial_exit_time - total_time_saved + new_total_exit_time)

# Lily found 7 more than David

# Let's assume the number of insects David found as 'd'
# Then, the number of insects Lily found is 'd + 7'

# We know that the total number of insects collected is X
# So, X = Lily's insects + David's insects + Bodhi's insects
