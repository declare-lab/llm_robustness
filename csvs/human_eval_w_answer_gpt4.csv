We can do this by iterating over each character in the string, checking if it is uppercase or lowercase, flipping its case, and incrementing a counter. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the `Tuple` class from the `typing` module, which allows us to specify a tuple as the return type of our function.

```python
from typing import Tuple
```

2. Define the function `flip_case_count` that takes a string as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string with flipped case, and the second element is the number of case flips performed.

```python
def flip_case_count(string: str) -> Tuple[str, int]:
```

3. Initialize a counter to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of case flips performed.

```python
    count = 0
```

4. Iterate over each character in the string. If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase and increment the counter. If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase and increment the counter. If the character is neither uppercase nor lowercase (for example, if it is a digit or a special character), leave it as it is.

```python
    flipped_string = ''
    for char in string:
        if char.isupper():
            flipped_string += char.lower()
            count += 1
        elif char.islower():
            flipped_string += char.upper()
            count += 1
        else:
            flipped_string += char
```

5. Return the flipped string and the count as a tuple.

```python
    return flipped_string, count
```

Here is the complete function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def flip_case_count(string: str) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    count = 0
    flipped_string = ''
    for char in string:
        if char.isupper():
            flipped_string += char.lower()
            count += 1
        elif char.islower():
            flipped_string += char.upper()
            count += 1
        else:
            flipped_string += char
    return flipped_string, count
```

This function should now solve the perturbed problem. For example, `flip_case_count('Hello')` will return `('hELLO', 5)`.","```python

```python

Step 5: Convert all the vowels in the new string to lowercase. This can be done by iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is a vowel. If it is, convert it to lowercase.

def swap_case(sentence: str) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
```

Step 2: Next, we need to convert the first word to lowercase. We can use the `lower()` function in Python, which converts all the characters in a string to lowercase.

```python
def swap_case(sentence: str) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
    words[0] = words[0].lower()
```

Step 3: Then, we need to convert the first character of each subsequent word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. We can use the `capitalize()` function in Python, which converts the first character of a string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.

```python
def swap_case(sentence: str) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
    words[0] = words[0].lower()
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        words[i] = words[i].capitalize()
```

Step 4: Finally, we need to join the words back into a string without spaces. We can use the `join()` function in Python, which concatenates all the elements in a list into a string.

```python
def swap_case(sentence: str) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
    words[0] = words[0].lower()
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        words[i] = words[i].capitalize()
    return ''.join(words)
```

So, the final function is:

```python
def swap_case(sentence: str) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
    words[0] = words[0].lower()
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        words[i] = words[i].capitalize()
    return ''.join(words)
```

This function will convert a sentence to camel case as required.","```python

    words = sentence.split()
    words[0] = words[0].lower()

    return ''.join(words)

```python
def flip_case_and_odd_sum(string: str) -> tuple:

Step 2: Iterate over the string.

Next, we need to iterate over the string. For each character in the string, we need to check if its position is even and if it is an odd letter. If both conditions are met, we add the character to the odd_letters string.

```python

What will be the output for `changed_function(masked_input)`","Find the output of the `changed_function`, if the input is the same.","Reasoning Step: The `swapcase()` method in python is used to swap the case of the string. In the case of the `original_function` method, it receives a string and returns the string but with all the lower case letters converted to upper case and vice versa. The `changed_function`, on the other hand, additionally reverses the string that is output by the swapcase function, indicated by `[::-1]`.

For `original_function(masked_input)`, we know that the output is 'hELLO'. So the `masked_input` should be the reverse case of 'hELLO', that is 'Hello'.

So, given that the `masked_input` is 'Hello', the `changed_function` will first swap the case to get 'hELLO'. After that, it will reverse this string, thus giving us 'OLLEh'.

Answer: 'OLLEh'","The `changed_function` is a perturbed version of the `original_function`. It not only swaps the case of the characters in the string, but also reverses the string.

Given that the `original_function(masked_input)` returns 'hELLO', we can infer that the `masked_input` was 'Hello'.

Now, if we input 'Hello' to the `changed_function`, it will first swap the case of the characters, resulting in 'hELLO', and then reverse the string, resulting in 'OLLEh'.

So, the output of `changed_function(masked_input)` will be 'OLLEh'.",,NA,TRUE

We can use Python's built-in type() function to check the type of the input and then handle each case accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the necessary modules. In this case, we need the Union and List from the typing module, and the Any from the typing module.

```python
from typing import Union, List, Dict, Any
```

2. Define the function. The function takes an input object which can be a string, a list of strings, or a dictionary with string values.

```python
def flip_case(input_obj: Union[str, List[str], Dict[Any, str]]):
```

3. Check the type of the input object using the type() function and handle each case accordingly.

    a. If the input object is a string, use the swapcase() method to flip the case of the characters and return the result.

    ```python
    if type(input_obj) == str:
        return input_obj.swapcase()
    ```

    b. If the input object is a list, iterate over the list, flip the case of each string using the swapcase() method, and return the result.

    ```python
    elif type(input_obj) == list:
        return [s.swapcase() for s in input_obj]
    ```

    c. If the input object is a dictionary, iterate over the dictionary, flip the case of each value using the swapcase() method, and return the result.

    ```python
    elif type(input_obj) == dict:
        return {k: v.swapcase() for k, v in input_obj.items()}
    ```

4. If the input object is not a string, a list, or a dictionary, raise a TypeError.

```python
else:
    raise TypeError(""Input should be a string, a list of strings, or a dictionary with string values."")

The problem is asking for the input to a function that flips the case of each character in a string. The output of the function is given as ""hELLO 9"".

Step 2: Analyze the function
The function uses the swapcase() method, which is a built-in Python method that swaps the case of each character in a string. If a character is uppercase, it becomes lowercase, and vice versa. If a character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.

Step 3: Determine the input
Given the output ""hELLO 9"", we can infer that the original input was ""Hello 9"". This is because the swapcase() method would have changed the uppercase ""H"" to lowercase ""h"", the lowercase ""ello"" to uppercase ""ELLO"", and left the "" 9"" unchanged.

The derivative of a polynomial is found by multiplying each term by its exponent and then reducing the exponent by one. For example, the derivative of x^2 is 2x, and the derivative of x is 1. 

In the perturbed problem, we are given a list of coefficients for a polynomial with three terms. The first term is a constant, the second term is multiplied by x, and the third term is multiplied by x^2. 

The derivative of the constant term is 0, the derivative of the x term is the coefficient of the x term, and the derivative of the x^2 term is 2 times the coefficient of the x^2 term.

Here are the steps to solve the perturbed problem:

1. First, we need to check if the list `xs` is empty or contains only one element. If it's empty, we return an empty list. If it contains only one element, we return a list with the element itself because the derivative of a constant is zero.

2. Then, we iterate over the list `xs` using the `enumerate` function which gives us both the index `i` and the element `x` at that index. 

3. For each element, we calculate the derivative as `i*x + x` because the derivative of a*x^n*exp(x) is given by a*n*exp(x) + a*x^n*exp(x). 

4. We append the result to a new list and return this list as the derivative of the polynomial.

Here is the Python function that implements these steps:

","The perturbed problem is asking for a python function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial. The coefficients of the polynomial are given in a list, and the derivative should be returned in the same form. The derivative of a term in a polynomial is calculated by multiplying the coefficient by the power of x in that term. 

Here is the step by step solution:

1. First, we need to handle the edge cases. If the list is empty, we return an empty list. If the list has only one element, we return a list with a single zero because the derivative of a constant is zero.

```python
    if len(xs) == 1: return [0]
    if len(xs) == 0: return []
```

2. Next, we calculate the derivative of the polynomial. We use the enumerate function to get both the index and the value from the list. The index represents the power of x in the term, and the value is the coefficient. We multiply the index by the value to get the derivative of the term. We start from the second element (index 1) because the derivative of the first term (which is a constant) is always zero.

```python
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]
```

3. The result is a list of the derivatives of each term in the polynomial, in the same form as the input.

The strings represent the coefficients of a polynomial. We need to convert these strings to integers, calculate the derivative, and then convert the results back to strings.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we need to check if the list is empty or contains only one element. If it's empty, we return an empty list. If it contains only one element, we return a list with a single element '0'. This is because the derivative of a constant is zero.

```python
    if len(xs) == 1: return ['0']
    if len(xs) == 0: return []
```

2. Then, we convert the strings in the list to integers using the map function. We also use the enumerate function to get the index and value of each element in the list.

```python
    xs = list(map(int, xs))
```

3. We calculate the derivative by multiplying the index and value of each element in the list, starting from the second element (index 1). We use a list comprehension for this.

```python
    derivative = [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]
```

4. Finally, we convert the results back to strings and return the list.

```python
    return list(map(str, derivative))
```

Step 1: Understand the function
The function takes a list of coefficients of a polynomial and returns the derivative of the polynomial in the same form. The derivative of a polynomial is calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and then reducing the power by 1. 

Step 2: Apply the constraints
If all the items in the input list are smaller than 1, then the output will also be smaller than the index of each item. This is because each item is multiplied by its index, and since the item is smaller than 1, the result will be smaller than the index.

Step 3: Formulate the constraints
So, the constraints on the output from this function are that all the items in the output list will be smaller than their corresponding index in the input list. 

For example, if the input list is [0.5, 0.3, 0.2], the output list will be [0.3, 0.4], where 0.3 < 2 and 0.4 < 3.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. First, we need to check if the length of xs is less than or equal to x. If it is, we return an empty list because the x order derivative of a polynomial with degree less than x is 0.

2. If the length of xs is greater than x, we calculate the x order derivative of the polynomial. We do this by differentiating the polynomial x times. 

3. To differentiate the polynomial, we use a for loop that runs x times. In each iteration, we calculate the derivative of the polynomial using the formula (i * xs[i]) for i in range(len(xs)). 

4. After calculating the derivative, we remove the first element from the list because the derivative of a constant is 0.

5. We repeat steps 3 and 4 x times to calculate the x order derivative of the polynomial.

    return [(i * i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]

What will be the output for `changed_function(masked_input)`","Find the output of the `changed_function`, if the input is the same. ","Reasoning Step:

In the original function, it returns the derivative of a polynomial where `xs` are the coefficients of a polynomial in the form of `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....`. The output is calculated by multiplying each element in the list by its index value starting from the second element (index 1).

The `changed_function`, on the other hand, is using the squares of the indices to calculate the output. It's still starting from the second element just like the `original_function`, but this time it's multiplying each element in the list by the square of its index value.

Given that the result of the `original_function(masked_input)` is `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, it suggests that:
- for `i = 1`, `x = 1` (1*1=1)
- for `i = 2`, `x = 2` (2*2=4)
- for `i = 3`, `x = 4` (3*4=12)
- for `i = 4`, `x = 5` (4*5=20)

Now, if we apply these values to the `changed_function`, we get:
- for `i = 1`, `x = 1`, `1*1*1 = 1`
- for `i = 2`, `x = 2`, `2*2*2 = 8`
- for `i = 3`, `x = 4`, `3*3*4 = 36`
- for `i = 4`, `x = 5`, `4*4*5 = 80`

Answer:

Therefore, the output for `changed_function(masked_input)` will be `[1, 8, 36, 80]`.","The `original_function` calculates the derivative of a polynomial, represented by a list of coefficients. The `changed_function` is a perturbed version of the `original_function` where each term in the derivative is multiplied by its index.

Given that the output of the `original_function` for `masked_input` is `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, we can infer that the `masked_input` is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`. This is because the derivative of a polynomial `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4` is `1 + 4x + 12x^2 + 20x^3`, represented as `[1, 4, 12, 20]`.

Now, let's find the output of the `changed_function` for the same `masked_input`:

1. The first term of the `masked_input` is `3`, but it is ignored in the `changed_function` because of the slice operation `[1:]`.
2. The second term is `1`. The index is `1`, so the result is `1*1*1 = 1`.
3. The third term is `2`. The index is `2`, so the result is `2*2*2 = 8`.
4. The fourth term is `4`. The index is `3`, so the result is `3*3*4 = 36`.
5. The fifth term is `5`. The index is `4`, so the result is `4*4*5 = 80`.

So, the output of the `changed_function(masked_input)` is `[1, 8, 36, 80]`.",,NA,TRUE

Step 2: Define the function. We will use the same function name as the original function, but with an additional parameter type.

```python
def derivative_generalized(xs: Union[list[int], list[float], str]):
```

Step 3: Inside the function, we need to check the type of the input. If it's a list, we can use the same logic as the original function. If it's a string, we need to parse it into a list of coefficients first.

```python
    if isinstance(xs, list):

Step 4: We need to define the helper function `parse_string_to_coefficients`. This function should take a string representing a polynomial and return a list of coefficients. This can be done by splitting the string by '+' and '^', and extracting the coefficients.

```python
def parse_string_to_coefficients(s: str):

    for term in terms:
        parts = term.split('x^')

        else:

The output of the function is a list of coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial.

The perturbed problem asks us to categorize all possible input parameters of the function that would result in the output [0, 3, 6].

Step 1: Understand the function
The function calculates the derivative of a polynomial. The derivative of a term in a polynomial is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of the term by the power of x in the term. For example, the derivative of 2x^2 is 4x. In the function, this is done by multiplying the index of each coefficient in the list by the coefficient itself.

Step 2: Find the input parameters
We need to find the input parameters that would result in the output [0, 3, 6]. This means that the derivative of the polynomial should be 0x^0 + 3x^1 + 6x^2. 

To get the original polynomial, we need to integrate the derivative. The integral of 0x^0 is 0x, the integral of 3x^1 is 1.5x^2, and the integral of 6x^2 is 2x^3. Therefore, the original polynomial is 0x + 1.5x^2 + 2x^3. 

The coefficients of this polynomial are [0, 1.5, 2]. Therefore, the input parameters that would result in the output [0, 3, 6] are [0, 1.5, 2].

Step 3: Categorize the input parameters
Since the function only takes one parameter, which is a list of coefficients of a polynomial, there is only one category of input parameters, which is lists of coefficients of polynomials. The input parameters that would result in the output [0, 3, 6] belong to this category.",,NA,TRUE

The first coefficient in the output is 0, which means the first coefficient in the input could be any number because any number multiplied by 0 is 0. 

The second coefficient in the output is 2, which means the second coefficient in the input is 2/1 = 2 because 2*1 = 2.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
```

2. Define the function that will be applied to each batch. This function will calculate the derivative of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients:

```python
def derivative_single(xs):
    if len(xs) == 1: return [0]
    if len(xs) == 0: return []
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]
```

3. Define the main function that will take a batch of inputs and distribute the work among multiple cores:

```python
def derivative_batch(xs_batch):
    with Pool() as p:
        results = p.map(derivative_single, xs_batch)
    return results
```

In this function, we create a pool of worker processes with `Pool()`. The `map` function applies the `derivative_single` function to each element of `xs_batch` in parallel. The results are collected into a list, which is then returned.

4. Now you can use the `derivative_batch` function to calculate the derivatives of multiple polynomials at once. For example:

```python
print(derivative_batch([[3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3]]))
```

This will output:

```python
[[1, 4, 12, 20], [2, 6]]
```

The integral of a polynomial is obtained by dividing each term by its exponent and increasing the exponent by 1. However, since the first item in xs is always 0, we can ignore it in the integration process.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define the function `integral` that takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input.

```python
def integral(xs: list):
```

2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the coefficients of the integral.

```python
    result = [0]
```

3. Iterate over the list `xs` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the coefficient `x`.

```python
    for i, x in enumerate(xs):
```

4. Divide the coefficient `x` by `i+1` to get the coefficient of the integral and append it to `result`.

```python
        result.append(x / (i + 1))
```

5. Return `result`.

```python
    return result
```

The complete function is:

```python
def integral(xs: list):
    result = [0]
    for i, x in enumerate(xs):
        result.append(x / (i + 1))

Here is the step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function takes a list of coefficients as input. These coefficients represent a polynomial. For example, if the input list is [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], it represents the polynomial 3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4.

2. The function first checks if the length of the list is 1 or 0. If the length is 1, it returns [0] because the derivative of a constant is 0. If the length is 0, it returns an empty list because there is no polynomial to differentiate.

3. If the length of the list is greater than 1, the function uses a list comprehension to calculate the derivative of the polynomial. It multiplies each coefficient by its index, which is equivalent to differentiating each term of the polynomial. The [1:] at the end of the list comprehension is used to exclude the first term (the constant term), because its derivative is 0.

4. The function returns the list of coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

Therefore, the original function already solves the perturbed problem.","```python

The formula to calculate the LCM is `a*b / gcd(a, b)`. 

Here is the step by step solution:

1. First, we import the Tuple from typing for the function return type.

```python
from typing import Tuple

2. Then, we define the function `greatest_common_divisor_and_least_common_multiple(a: int, b: int) -> Tuple[int, int]`.

```python
def greatest_common_divisor_and_least_common_multiple(a: int, b: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:

3. Inside the function, we calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) using the same logic as the original function.

```python
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    gcd = abs(a)
```

4. Then, we calculate the least common multiple (lcm) using the formula `a*b / gcd`.

```python
    lcm = abs(a*b) // gcd
```

5. Finally, we return the gcd and lcm as a tuple.

```python
    return gcd, lcm
```

Step 2: Use a while loop to find the GCD. The loop continues until b becomes 0. In each iteration, the value of a is replaced by b and the value of b is replaced by the remainder of a divided by b.

```python
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
```

Step 3: After the loop, the absolute value of a is the GCD of the original a and b. 

```python
    gcd = abs(a)
```

Step 4: Return the GCD and an explanation of how it is determined. 

```python
    return gcd, f""For the inputs ({a}, {b}), the highest number that divides both numbers evenly is {gcd}, so the GCD is {gcd}.""

We can do this by multiplying the inputs by a large power of 10 to convert them to integers, then finding the greatest common divisor of these integers, and finally dividing the result by the same power of 10 to convert it back to a float.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define the function `greatest_common_divisor(decimal1: float, decimal2: float) -> float:`

2. Inside the function, convert the inputs to integers by multiplying them by a large power of 10. The power of 10 should be large enough to ensure that the decimal parts of the inputs are also converted to integers. For example, if the inputs have 3 decimal places, you can multiply them by 10^3 = 1000.

3. Use the original `greatest_common_divisor` function to find the greatest common divisor of these integers.

4. Convert the result back to a float by dividing it by the same power of 10.

5. Return the result.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(decimal1: float, decimal2: float) -> float:
    # Convert the inputs to integers
    factor = 10 ** max(len(str(decimal1).split('.')[1]), len(str(decimal2).split('.')[1]))
    int1 = int(decimal1 * factor)
    int2 = int(decimal2 * factor)

    # Find the greatest common divisor of the integers
    while int2:
        int1, int2 = int2, int1 % int2

    # Convert the result back to a float
    result = abs(int1) / factor

    return result
```

This function should work correctly for any two floating point numbers. However, it may not give the exact result for very large or very small numbers due to the limitations of floating point precision.","```python
def greatest_common_divisor(decimal1: float, decimal2: float) -> float:
    # Convert the inputs to integers

We can do this by iterating from 1 to the gcd and checking if both a and b are divisible by the current number. If they are, we add it to a set of common divisors. We use a set to automatically remove duplicates.

Next, we iterate through the set of common divisors and add up all the odd numbers.

```python
    common_divisors = {i for i in range(1, gcd + 1) if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0}
    odd_sum = sum(i for i in common_divisors if i % 2 != 0)

    return largest_common_float","Step 1: Import the necessary libraries. In this case, we need the Union type hint from the typing module.

```python
from typing import Union
```

Step 2: Define the function. The function will take two arguments, value1 and value2, which can be integers, floats, or strings.

```python
def find_common_divisor(value1: Union[int, float, str], value2: Union[int, float, str]) -> float:
```

Step 3: Convert the inputs to floats. This is necessary because the inputs can be strings, and we need to perform mathematical operations on them.

```python
    value1 = float(value1)
    value2 = float(value2)
```

Step 4: Find the smallest value between value1 and value2. This is because the greatest common divisor cannot be larger than the smallest value.

```python
    smallest = min(value1, value2)
```

Step 5: Initialize the greatest common divisor to 1. This is because 1 is the smallest possible divisor.

```python
    gcd = 1.0
```

Step 6: Iterate over all possible divisors from 1 to the smallest value. For each divisor, check if it divides both value1 and value2 into integers. If it does, update the greatest common divisor.

```python
    for i in range(1, int(smallest * 10000) + 1):
        divisor = i / 10000.0
        if value1 % divisor == 0 and value2 % divisor == 0:
            gcd = divisor
```

Step 7: Return the greatest common divisor.

```python
    return gcd

Here is the complete function:

```python
from typing import Union

        if value1 % divisor == 0 and value2 % divisor == 0:
            gcd = divisor

","The perturbed problem is asking for a Python function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for computing the GCD of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. It is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we need to define the function with two integer parameters, a and b.

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
```

2. Then, we need to implement the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number by the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number. This process continues until one of the numbers becomes 0. The other number at that point is the GCD of the original pair.

```python
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
```

3. Finally, we need to return the GCD. At this point, b is 0, and a contains the GCD of the original numbers.

```python
    return abs(a)
```

So, the complete function is:

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)
```

This function will return the GCD of two integers a and b. For example, greatest_common_divisor(3, 5) will return 1, and greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) will return 5.","```python

```python
import multiprocessing
```

Step 2: Define the original function. We don't need to modify this function.

    while b:

    results = pool.starmap(greatest_common_divisor, inputs)
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    return results
```

In this function, we first create a multiprocessing pool with the number of cores in the CPU. Then we use the starmap function to apply the greatest_common_divisor function to each tuple in the input list. The starmap function is similar to the map function, but it allows multiple arguments. Finally, we close the pool and wait for all processes to finish with pool.close() and pool.join().

Step 4: Test the function with some inputs.

```python
print(batch_gcd([(3, 5), (25, 15), (100, 200)]))  # Output: [1, 5, 100]

Step 2: Implement the Euclidean algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm is a way to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until the two numbers are equal. In this case, we use a while loop to implement the algorithm. Inside the loop, we replace a with b and b with the remainder of a divided by b. We continue this process until b is 0.

```python

5. If the integer is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, append it to the `result` list without any modification.

6. After the loop ends, return the sum of all entries in the `result` list.

","The perturbed problem is asking for the same functionality as the original problem, but with more detailed explanations in the examples. Therefore, the solution will be the same as the original function.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define the function sum_squares that takes a list of integers as an argument.

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
```

2. Initialize an empty list result to store the modified entries.

```python
    result =[]
```

3. Iterate over the list using a for loop. The range function is used to generate the indexes of the list.

```python
    for i in range(len(lst)):
```

4. Check if the index is a multiple of 3 using the modulus operator. If it is, square the entry at that index and append it to the result list.

```python
        if i %3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
```

5. If the index is not a multiple of 3, check if it is a multiple of 4 using the modulus operator. If it is, cube the entry at that index and append it to the result list.

```python
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
```

6. If the index is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, append the entry at that index to the result list without modifying it.

```python
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
```

7. After the for loop, return the sum of all entries in the result list.

```python
    return sum(result)
```

8. The function is now complete. It will return the sum of all entries in the list, with entries at indexes that are multiples of 3 squared, entries at indexes that are multiples of 4 (but not 3) cubed, and all other entries unchanged.","#extracted python functions#

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we need to create a dictionary that maps each character to its position in the English alphabet. We can do this by using the built-in `ord` function, which returns the Unicode code point of a character. For example, `ord('a')` returns 97, so `ord('a') - 96` gives us the position of 'a' in the alphabet.

2. Next, we initialize an empty list to store the processed values.

3. We then iterate over the characters in the input list. For each character, we get its position in the alphabet using the dictionary we created earlier.

4. If the character's position in the list (1-indexed) is a multiple of 3, we square its alphabetical position and append it to the list. If the character's position in the list is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, we raise its alphabetical position to the power of 3 and append it to the list. If the character's position in the list is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, we simply append its alphabetical position to the list.

5. Finally, we return the sum of the values in the list.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:

```python
def calculate_transformed_sum(character_list):
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(character_list, start=1):
        pos = ord(char.lower()) - 96

            result.append(pos ** 3)
        else:
            result.append(pos)
    return sum(result)
```

This function should work as expected for the given examples. For example, `calculate_transformed_sum(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])` returns 81, and `calculate_transformed_sum(['x', 'y', 'z'])` returns 725.","#extracted python functions

3. Squaring, raising to the power of 4, or raising to the power of 6 any integer will always result in a positive number or zero. However, since the function sums all these results, the final output can be any integer from negative infinity to positive infinity, depending on the input list.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define the function `sum_squares(lst, multiple)`. This function takes two parameters: a list of integers `lst` and an integer `multiple`.

2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the modified entries of the list.

3. Iterate over the list `lst` using a for loop. For each iteration, the index `i` of the current entry is obtained using the `range(len(lst))` function.

4. Inside the loop, check if the index `i` is a multiple of 3 using the condition `i % 3 == 0`. If it is, square the integer entry at index `i` and append it to the `result` list.

5. If the index `i` is not a multiple of 3, check if it is a multiple of the specified value using the condition `i % multiple == 0`. If it is, cube the integer entry at index `i` and append it to the `result` list.

6. If the index `i` is neither a multiple of 3 nor the specified value, append the integer entry at index `i` to the `result` list without modifying it.

7. After the loop, return the sum of all entries in the `result` list using the `sum(result)` function.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def sum_squares(lst, multiple):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)

        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)

The original function squares the number if its index is a multiple of 3, cubes the number if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, and leaves the number unchanged if its index is not a multiple of 3 or 4.

The changed function squares the number if its index is a multiple of 3, cubes the number if its index is a multiple of 2, and leaves the number unchanged if its index is not a multiple of 2 or 3.

Step 2: Understand the given condition.

We know that if we input [1, 2, masked_digit] to the original_function, the output is 6. This means that 1^2 + 2 + masked_digit = 6. Solving this equation gives us masked_digit = 3.

Step 3: Apply the changed function to the list [1, 2, 3].

For the first number (1), its index is 0, which is a multiple of 3, so we square it to get 1.

For the second number (2), its index is 1, which is not a multiple of 2 or 3, so we leave it unchanged to get 2.

For the third number (3), its index is 2, which is a multiple of 2, so we cube it to get 27.

Step 4: Sum the results.

The sum of 1, 2, and 27 is 30.

for i in range(len(lst)):
```

Step 3: Inside the for loop, check if the index i is a multiple of 3. We can use the modulus operator for this.

```python
if i % 3 == 0:
```

Step 4: If the condition in step 3 is true, append the square of the element at index i to the result list. We can use the append method and the power operator for this.

```python
result.append(lst[i]**2)
```

Step 5: Next, check if the index i is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. We can use the modulus operator and the not equal operator for this.

```python
elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
```

Step 6: If the condition in step 5 is true, append the cube of the element at index i to the result list. We can use the append method and the power operator for this.

```python
result.append(lst[i]**3)
```

Step 7: If none of the above conditions are met, append the element as it is.

```python
else:
    result.append(lst[i])

Step 8: After the for loop, return the sum of all elements in the result list. We can use the sum function for this.

```python
return sum(result)

","Find the shortest list of integers that, when input into the following function, results in an output of 15.",[5],"Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking for the shortest list of integers that, when input into the function, results in an output of 15. The function squares the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 3 and cubes the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function does not change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4.

Step 2: Identify the pattern
The function squares the integer at index 0, 3, 6, 9, etc. (multiples of 3) and cubes the integer at index 4, 8, 12, etc. (multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 3). All other integers are left unchanged.

Step 3: Find the shortest list
We need to find the shortest list of integers that results in an output of 15. Since squaring and cubing generally result in larger numbers, we should start with small integers. 

Let's start with the list [1]. The function squares the first integer (1^2 = 1), so the output is 1. This is less than 15, so we need to add more integers.

Next, let's try the list [1, 1]. The function leaves the second integer unchanged (1), so the output is 1 + 1 = 2. This is still less than 15, so we need to add more integers.

Next, let's try the list [1, 1, 1]. The function leaves the third integer unchanged (1), so the output is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. This is still less than 15, so we need to add more integers.

Next, let's try the list [1, 1, 1, 2]. The function squares the fourth integer (2^2 = 4), so the output is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7. This is still less than 15, so we need to add more integers.

Finally, let's try the list [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. The function cubes the fifth integer (2^3 = 8), so the output is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15. This is equal to 15, so we have found the shortest list of integers that results in an output of 15.

So, the shortest list of integers that, when input into the function, results in an output of 15 is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2].",,NA,FALSE

1. Import the necessary modules:

import multiprocessing as mp
```

2. Define a function to process a chunk of the list:

```python
def process_chunk(chunk, start_index):
    result = []

        index = i + start_index

        else:
            result.append(chunk[i])
    return sum(result)
```

3. Define a function to split the list into chunks:

```python
def chunks(lst, n):
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        yield lst[i:i + n]
```

4. Define the main function:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    pool = mp.Pool(mp.cpu_count())
    chunk_size = len(lst) // mp.cpu_count()
    results = [pool.apply_async(process_chunk, args=(chunk, i*chunk_size)) for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks(lst, chunk_size))]
    return sum(result.get() for result in results)

Given that all elements in the list are equal and the length of the list is 4, we can reverse the process by taking the fourth root of the first element (since it's at an index that's a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3), the square root of the third element (since it's at an index that's a multiple of 3), and leaving the second and fourth elements as they are (since their indices are not multiples of 3 or 4).

","The perturbed problem requires us to modify the original function to check if there are at least 'num' nested brackets in the string. We can achieve this by modifying the 'depth' variable in the original function to keep track of the maximum depth of nested brackets encountered so far. If this maximum depth is greater than or equal to 'num', we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Here is the modified function:

```python
def is_nested(string, num):
    stack = []
    depth = 0
    max_depth = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if char == '[':

                stack.pop()
                depth -= 1
    return max_depth >= num
```

Let's go through the steps of this function:

1. Initialize an empty stack and two variables 'depth' and 'max_depth' to 0.

2. Iterate over each character in the string.

3. If the character is an opening bracket ('['), push it onto the stack and increment 'depth' by 1. If 'depth' is greater than 'max_depth', update 'max_depth' to be equal to 'depth'.

4. If the character is a closing bracket (']'), check if the stack is not empty. If it's not, pop the top element from the stack and decrement 'depth' by 1.

5. After iterating over all the characters in the string, check if 'max_depth' is greater than or equal to 'num'. If it is, return True. Otherwise, return False.

This function works by maintaining a stack of opening brackets and using the 'depth' variable to keep track of the current depth of nested brackets. The 'max_depth' variable is used to keep track of the maximum depth of nested brackets encountered so far. If 'max_depth' is greater than or equal to 'num' at the end of the function, this means that there is a subsequence of brackets in the string where at least 'num' brackets are nested.","```python

Here is how we can modify the original function to solve the perturbed problem:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of valid nested bracket pairs. Let's call this variable `nested_pairs`.

2. In the original function, whenever a valid nested bracket pair is found, the function returns `True` and stops further execution. Instead, we should increment the `nested_pairs` counter and continue checking the rest of the string.

3. At the end of the function, return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether there exists a valid nested subsequence of brackets and the count of valid nested bracket pairs.

Here is the modified function:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    depth = 0
    nested_pairs = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if char == '[':

            if depth > 0:

            if len(stack) > 0:

            if depth >= 2:
                nested_pairs += 1

            if len(stack) == 0:
                depth = 0
    return (nested_pairs > 0, nested_pairs)
```

Now, the function will return both whether there exists a valid nested subsequence of brackets and the number of valid nested bracket pairs found in the string. For example, `is_nested('[[]][[][]]')` will return `(True, 2)`.","```python

Here is the step by step solution:

1. Add a new parameter print_nested_sequence to the function signature.

2. Initialize an empty string nested_sequence to keep track of the current bracket subsequence.

3. In the for loop, append the current character to nested_sequence when a '[' is encountered and pop the last character from nested_sequence when a ']' is encountered.

4. When a valid nested bracket subsequence is found (i.e., depth >= 2), check if print_nested_sequence is True. If it is, print nested_sequence.

1. Initialize the depth and max_depth variables to 0. These variables will keep track of the current depth of the nested brackets and the maximum depth reached so far, respectively.

2. Iterate over each character in the input string.

3. If the character is an opening bracket, call the handle_open_bracket function with the current depth and max_depth as arguments. This function will increase the depth by 1 and update the max_depth if the new depth is greater than the current max_depth.

4. If the character is a closing bracket, call the handle_close_bracket function with the current depth and max_depth as arguments. This function will decrease the depth by 1 (but not below 0), and check if the difference between the max_depth and the new depth is greater than 1. If it is, the function will return True, indicating that a nested bracket has been found. If the depth reaches 0, the max_depth is reset to 0.

5. If the handle_close_bracket function returns True at any point, return True from the is_nested function as well.

6. If the loop completes without finding any nested brackets, return False.

We can do this by maintaining a variable to store the current subsequence and another variable to store the longest subsequence. We update the current subsequence whenever we encounter a closing bracket and the stack is not empty. We update the longest subsequence whenever the length of the current subsequence is greater than the length of the longest subsequence.

Here is the step by step solution:

1. Initialize an empty list `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. Initialize a variable `current_subsequence` to an empty string to keep track of the current subsequence.
3. Initialize a variable `longest_subsequence` to an empty string to keep track of the longest subsequence.
4. Iterate over each character in the string.
5. If the character is an opening bracket, append it to the `stack` and add it to the `current_subsequence`.
6. If the character is a closing bracket and the `stack` is not empty, pop the last element from the `stack` and add the closing bracket to the `current_subsequence`.
7. If the `stack` is empty, this means that the current subsequence has ended. Compare the length of the `current_subsequence` with the length of the `longest_subsequence`. If the `current_subsequence` is longer, update the `longest_subsequence` to be the `current_subsequence`. Then reset the `current_subsequence` to an empty string.
8. After the loop, return the `longest_subsequence`.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    current_subsequence = ''
    longest_subsequence = ''
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append('[')
            current_subsequence += '['
        elif char == ']' and stack:
            stack.pop()
            current_subsequence += ']'
            if not stack:
                if len(current_subsequence) > len(longest_subsequence):
                    longest_subsequence = current_subsequence
                current_subsequence = ''
    return longest_subsequence
```

It updates the current subsequence whenever it encounters a bracket and updates the longest subsequence whenever the current subsequence ends and is longer than the longest subsequence.","```python

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable depth to 0.

2. Iterate over each character in the string.

3. If the character is an opening bracket:
    - Push it onto the stack.
    - If the depth is greater than 0, decrease it by 1.

    - If the stack is not empty, pop an opening bracket from the stack and increase the depth by 1.

    - If the stack is empty, reset the depth to 0.

5. If the function has gone through the entire string without returning True, return False.

","The perturbed problem is similar to the original problem, but it uses curly brackets instead of square brackets. We can solve this problem by modifying the original function to handle curly brackets instead of square brackets. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty list called `stack` and a variable `depth` with a value of 0. The `stack` will be used to keep track of the opening brackets, and `depth` will be used to keep track of the nesting level.

2. Iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is an opening bracket (`{`), append it to the `stack` and decrease `depth` by 1 if `depth` is greater than 0. If the character is a closing bracket (`}`), check if the `stack` is not empty. If it's not, pop the last element from the `stack` and increase `depth` by 1.

3. If `depth` is greater than or equal to 2 at any point, return `True` because this means that there is at least one nested bracket in the string.

4. If the `stack` is empty after processing a closing bracket, reset `depth` to 0.

5. If the function has iterated over all characters in the string and hasn't returned `True`, return `False`. This means that there are no nested brackets in the string.

1. Define the function is_nested that takes a list as input.

2. Initialize an empty list called stack and a variable depth set to 0. These will be used to keep track of the brackets and their nesting level.

3. Iterate over the input list. For each character in the list:

    a. If the character is an opening bracket ('['), append it to the stack. If the depth is greater than 0, decrement the depth by 1.

    b. If the character is a closing bracket (']'), check if the stack is not empty. If it's not, pop the last element from the stack and increment the depth by 1. If the depth is greater than or equal to 2, return 'True'. If the stack is empty, reset the depth to 0.

4. If the function has not returned 'True' after iterating over the entire list, return 'False'.

Here is the Python code for the function:

```python
def is_nested(lst):
    stack = []
    depth = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(lst):
        if char == '[':
            stack.append('[')
            if depth > 0:
                depth -= 1
        elif char == ']':
            if len(stack) > 0:
                stack.pop()
                depth += 1
            if depth >= 2:
                return 'True'
            if len(stack) == 0:
                depth = 0
    return 'False'
```

This function should work as expected for the perturbed problem.","#extracted python functions#

Here is the step by step solution:

1. Initialize a counter for open square brackets in even positions and close square brackets in odd positions.

2. Iterate over the string. For each character, check if it is an open or close square bracket.

3. If it is an open square bracket, add it to the stack. If the current index is even, increment the counter for open square brackets in even positions.

4. If it is a close square bracket, check if the stack is not empty. If it is not, pop the last element from the stack. If the current index is odd, increment the counter for close square brackets in odd positions.

5. If the stack is empty after popping an element, reset the depth to 0.

6. If the depth is greater than or equal to 2 at any point, return True and the count of open square brackets in even positions.

7. If the function has iterated over the entire string without returning, return False and the count of close square brackets in odd positions.

Here is the step by step solution:

1. Define a dictionary to map the opening and closing brackets. This will help us to check if the brackets are matching or not.

2. Initialize an empty list to use as a stack. We will use this stack to keep track of the opening brackets.

3. Iterate over the characters in the string. 

4. If the character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack.

5. If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty or the top element of the stack is not the matching opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, return False.

6. If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is the matching opening bracket, pop the top element from the stack.

7. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here is the Python code for the above steps:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    bracket_map = {""["": ""]"", ""{"": ""}"", ""("": "")"", ""<"": "">""}
    open_brackets = set([""["", ""{"", ""("", ""<""])

","To solve the perturbed problem, we need to modify the original function to handle batch inputs and utilize multicore CPUs. We can achieve this by using Python's multiprocessing module, which allows us to create a pool of worker processes that can execute tasks in parallel.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
```

2. Define the original function:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    depth = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if char == '[':
            stack.append('[')
            if depth > 0:
                depth -= 1
        elif char == ']':
            if len(stack) > 0:
                stack.pop()
                depth += 1
            if depth >= 2:
                return True
            if len(stack) == 0:
                depth = 0
    return False
```

3. Define a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of results:

```python
def is_nested_batch(strings):
    with Pool() as p:
        results = p.map(is_nested, strings)
    return results
```

In the `is_nested_batch` function, we create a pool of worker processes with `Pool()`. The `map` function applies the `is_nested` function to each string in the input list in parallel. The results are collected into a list, which is then returned.

Now, you can use the `is_nested_batch` function to process a batch of strings in parallel:

```python
strings = ['[[]]', '[]]]]]]][[[[[]', '[][]', '[]', '[[][]]', '[[]][[']
print(is_nested_batch(strings))
```

This will output a list of boolean values indicating whether each string in the input list is nested or not.",,NA,TRUE

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty list called `stack` and a variable `depth` with a value of 0. The `stack` will be used to keep track of the opening brackets and `depth` will be used to keep track of the nesting level.

2. Iterate over each character in the input string. 

3. If the character is an opening bracket ('['), append it to the `stack` and decrease the `depth` by 1 if `depth` is greater than 0.

4. If the character is a closing bracket (']'), check if the `stack` is not empty. If it is not, pop the last element from the `stack` and increase the `depth` by 1.

5. If the `depth` is greater than or equal to 2 at any point, return True. This means that there is at least one nested bracket in the string.

6. If the `stack` is empty after popping an element, reset the `depth` to 0.

7. If the `stack` is not empty after iterating over all the characters in the string, return False. This means that there are unmatched opening brackets in the string.

8. If none of the above conditions are met, return False. This means that there are no nested brackets in the string.

Here is the modified function:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    depth = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if char == '[':
            stack.append('[')
            if depth > 0:
                depth -= 1
        elif char == ']':
            if len(stack) > 0:
                stack.pop()
                depth += 1
            else:
                return False
            if depth >= 2:

            if len(stack) == 0:
                depth = 0
    return len(stack) == 0 and depth == 0
